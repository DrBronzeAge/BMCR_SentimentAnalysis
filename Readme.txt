This is the Readme for the initial commit of my NLP/Sentiment analysis 
code for surveying 20 years of Book Reviews in Classics and Ancient History
We'll start with the most generalize-able parts and move to more specific parts.

If, for some reason, you decide you would like to run all of this yourself, even though you're
a complete newb, here's a (possibly incomplete) list of things you'll need:
1) A working copy of python version 3+
2) the NLTK library
3) the Pandas library
4) Beautiful Soup
5) Jellyfish
6) pymongo
7) a working installation of MongoDB
8) a working installation of R
9) the WordCloud library for R
10) the png library for R

And those are only the libraries that DONT come standard with any installation of Python and R
More to come
